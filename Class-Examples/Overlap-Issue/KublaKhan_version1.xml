    <line>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</line>
    <line>A stately pleasure-dome decree:</line>
    <line>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran</line>
    <line>Through caverns measureless to man</line>
    <line>Down to a sunless sea.</line>
    
    <line>So twice five miles of fertile ground</line>
    <line>With walls and towers were girdled round:</line>
    <line>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,</line>
    <line>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</line>
    <line>And here were forests ancient as the hills,</line>
    <line>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</line>
    
    <line>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted</line>
    <line>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</line>
    <line>A savage place! as holy and enchanted</line>
    <line>As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted</line>
    <line>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</line>
    <line>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,</line>
    <line>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</line>
    <line>A mighty fountain momently was forced:</line>
    <line>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst</line>
    <line>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,</line>
    <line>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:</line>
    <line>And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever</line>
    <line>It flung up momently the sacred river.</line>
    <line>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</line>
    <line>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</line>
    <line>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,</line>
    <line>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:</line>
    <line>And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</line>
    <line>Ancestral voices prophesying war!</line>

    <line>The shadow of the dome of pleasure</line>
    <line>Floated midway on the waves;</line>
    <line>Where was heard the mingled measure</line>
    <line>From the fountain and the caves.</line>
    <line>It was a miracle of rare device,</line>
    <line>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</line>

    <line>A damsel with a dulcimer</line>
    <line>In a vision once I saw:</line>
    <line>It was an Abyssinian maid,</line>
    <line>And on her dulcimer she played,</line>
    <line>Singing of Mount Abora.</line>
    <line>Could I revive within me</line>
    <line>Her symphony and song,</line>
    <line>To such a deep delight 'twould win me</line>
    <line>That with music loud and long</line>
    <line>I would build that dome in air,</line>
    <line>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!</line>
    <line>And all who heard should see them there,</line>
    <line>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!</line>
    <line>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!</line>
    <line>Weave a circle round him thrice,</line>
    <line>And close your eyes with holy dread,</line>
    <line>For he on honey-dew hath fed</line>
    <line>And drunk the milk of Paradise.</line>
