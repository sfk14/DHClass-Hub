<poem><title>Kubla Khan</title> 
    In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<lb/> 
    A stately pleasure-dome decree:<lb/>
    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<lb/> 
    Through caverns measureless to man<lb/> 
    Down to a sunless sea.<lb/> 
    So twice five miles of fertile ground<lb/> 
    With walls and towers were girdled round:<lb/> 
    And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<lb/> 
    Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<lb/> 
    And here were forests ancient as the hills,<lb/> 
    Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<lb/> 
    
    But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<lb/> 
    Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<lb/> 
    A savage place! <simile genre="Gothic">as holy and enchanted<lb/>
        As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<lb/> 
        By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</simile><lb/> 
    And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<lb/> 
    As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<lb/> 
    A mighty fountain momently was forced:<lb/>
    Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<lb/> 
    Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<lb/>
    Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:<lb/> 
    And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<lb/> 
    It flung up momently the sacred river.<lb/> 
    Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<lb/> 
    Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<lb/> 
    Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<lb/> 
    And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:<lb/> 
    And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<lb/> 
    Ancestral voices prophesying war!<lb/> 
    
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure<lb/> 
    Floated midway on the waves;<lb/> 
    Where was heard the mingled measure<lb/> 
    From the fountain and the caves.<lb/> 
    It was a miracle of rare device,<lb/> 
    A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<lb/> 
    
    A damsel with a dulcimer<lb/> 
    In a vision once I saw:<lb/> 
    It was an Abyssinian maid,<lb/> 
    And on her dulcimer she played,<lb/> 
    Singing of Mount Abora.<lb/> 
    Could I revive within me<lb/> 
    Her symphony and song,<lb/> 
    To such a deep delight 'twould win me<lb/>
    That with music loud and long<lb/> 
    I would build that dome in air,<lb/> 
    That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<lb/> 
    And all who heard should see them there,<lb/> 
    And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<lb/> 
    His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<lb/> 
    Weave a circle round him thrice,<lb/>
    And close your eyes with holy dread,<lb/> 
    For he on honey-dew hath fed<lb/> 
    And drunk the milk of Paradise.<lb/>
