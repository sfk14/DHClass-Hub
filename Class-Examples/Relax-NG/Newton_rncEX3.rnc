# ebb  We noticed that you put a repetition indicator on rhyme, but it's an attribute, so literally you can't use it more than once! This doesn't cause a problem in your schema, and it's okay in your XML because you always have at least one rhyme, but you really don't want a repetition indicator here. Rewrite thus:
# stanza = element stanza {n, rhyme, line+}
n = attribute n {xsd:int}
# ebb jmh (after class 2017-01-20: great use of data types! We could actually re-use this attribute on MULTIPLE elements, now that we have defined its contents. All we have to do is indicate WHERE we want to permit it. So we'd suggest using n INSTEAD of the l attribute that you're putting on line.
rhyme = attribute rhyme {text}
line = element line {l, mixed{literary_device*}} 
#2017-01-20 ebb jmh: In class today, we corrected your original code to move the l attribute out of the mixed syntax. We'd actually recommend to change @l over to @n, since you're really @n the same way, to count stuff! 

l = attribute l {xsd:int}

literary_device = element literary_device {mixed{(alliteration | repetition | metaphor)*}}
alliteration = attribute alliteration {text}
repetition = attribute repetition {text}
metaphor = attribute metaphor {text}

#2017-01-20 JMH ebb: Good work here, and this gave us a great example to play with in class. (THANK YOU!) :-) 
# You also are thinking as if you could use your schema for multiple documents, using the repetition indicators
# to your advantage. camelCase is usually what we prefer to use when tagging and it might be
# easier for you than using underscores, so we'd suggest to use it more in the future. Score: 8.5/10
