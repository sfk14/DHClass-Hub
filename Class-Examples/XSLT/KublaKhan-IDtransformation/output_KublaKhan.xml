<l n="1">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</l>
<l n="2">A stately pleasure-dome decree:</l>
<l n="3">Where Alph, the sacred river, ran</l>
<l n="4">Through caverns measureless to man</l>
<l n="5">Down to a sunless sea.</l>

<l n="6">So twice five miles of fertile ground</l>
<l n="7">With walls and towers were girdled round:</l>
<l n="8">And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,</l>
<l n="9">Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</l>
<l n="10">And here were forests ancient as the hills,</l>
<l n="11">Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</l>

<l n="12">But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted</l>
<l n="13">Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</l>
<l n="14">A savage place! as holy and enchanted</l>
<l n="15">As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted</l>
<l n="16">By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</l>
<l n="17">And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,</l>
<l n="18">As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</l>
<l n="19">A mighty fountain momently was forced:</l>
<l n="20">Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst</l>
<l n="21">Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,</l>
<l n="22">Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:</l>
<l n="23">And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever</l>
<l n="24">It flung up momently the sacred river.</l>
<l n="25">Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</l>
<l n="26">Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</l>
<l n="27">Then reached the caverns measureless to man,</l>
<l n="28">And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:</l>
<l n="29">And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</l>
<l n="30">Ancestral voices prophesying war!</l>

<l n="31">The shadow of the dome of pleasure</l>
<l n="32">Floated midway on the waves;</l>
<l n="33">Where was heard the mingled measure</l>
<l n="34">From the fountain and the caves.</l>
<l n="35">It was a miracle of rare device,</l>
<l n="36">A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</l>

<l n="37">A damsel with a dulcimer</l>
<l n="38">In a vision once I saw:</l>
<l n="39">It was an Abyssinian maid,</l>
<l n="40">And on her dulcimer she played,</l>
<l n="41">Singing of Mount Abora.</l>
<l n="42">Could I revive within me</l>
<l n="43">Her symphony and song,</l>
<l n="44">To such a deep delight 'twould win me</l>
<l n="45">That with music loud and long</l>
<l n="46">I would build that dome in air,</l>
<l n="47">That sunny dome! those caves of ice!</l>
<l n="48">And all who heard should see them there,</l>
<l n="49">And all should cry, Beware! Beware!</l>
<l n="50">His flashing eyes, his floating hair!</l>
<l n="51">Weave a circle round him thrice,</l>
<l n="52">And close your eyes with holy dread,</l>
<l n="53">For he on honey-dew hath fed</l>
<l n="54">And drunk the milk of Paradise.</l>
