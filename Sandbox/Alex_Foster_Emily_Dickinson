I think it is a really cool concept for a website. To be able to look at the original works as well as their modern day publications is a very awesome concept.
I dabbled with manuscripts in the past, and it's very intriguing to me to be able to look at what originally was there, and then be able to look to later works and see just how similar or different they really are.
It helps the reader understand how history in language has changed, and how certain works are altered and manipulated to keep up with the times, all while still trying to deliver the same message as it was originally intended.
I felt that the layout of the site was very helpful and easy to explore. I really dig how this was created by our students and actually put a lot of thought, time, and effort to make this a professional design as well as a very in depth assignment about Emily Dickinson's works and their modern day interpretations.
