            <description>Some critics were quick to focus on her sex, asserting that her election was an affront to others in the denomination who opposed the ordination of women. They described it as further evidence of the church's drift from the shared beliefs of the greater Communion. "In many ways the election speaks for itself," of Pittsburgh said in a statement. is the moderator of the Communion Network, a theologically conservative group of dioceses. "For the Communion worldwide, this election reveals the continuing insensitivity and disregard of the Church for the present dynamics of our global fellowship." will be the 26th presiding bishop of the Church. As such, she will represent the church in meetings with other leaders from around the world and with leaders of other religious groups. But her powers are limited because of the Church's tradition of autonomy for its dioceses, including the right to elect their own bishops. It would also result in two competing provinces on the same soil, each claiming the mantle of historical Anglican Christianity. The conservatives have named theirs the Anglican Church in North America. And for the first time, a province would be defined not by geography, but by theological orientation. “We’re going through Reformation times, and in Reformation times things aren’t neat and clean,” Bishop Robert Duncan of Pittsburgh, a conservative who led his diocese out of the Episcopal Church in October, said in an interview. “In Reformation times, new structures are emerging.” Besides Pittsburgh, those dioceses are Fort Worth; Quincy, Ill.; and San Joaquin, in the Central Valley of California — representing 4 of 110 dioceses in the Episcopal Church. But not all the parishes and Episcopalians in those four dioceses agreed to leave the Episcopal Church. Bishop Duncan, whose theological orientation is more evangelical, has ordained women in the diocese of Pittsburgh. Bishops of other breakaway dioceses, like Jack Iker in Fort Worth and John-David Schofield in San Joaquin, are more “Anglo-Catholic” in orientation, modeling some elements of the Roman Catholic Church, and are opposed to ordaining women as priests or bishops. In response to a lawsuit led by one of its parishes, the Diocese of Pittsburgh has agreed to have a court-appointed neutral party inventory all of its property and assets as it prepares for a final vote on seceding from the Church. The 2005 agreement said that property held by the central diocese -- such as endowment funds, but not necessarily parish property -- would continue to be held by the " Diocese of Pittsburgh of the Church of the United States of America" whether or not any parishes or diocesan leaders secede. Calvary claims that the diocese has violated its end of the 2005 agreement. The diocese also agreed yesterday to permit parishes that oppose secession to divert diocesan support payments to escrow accounts that would remain in the Church. The agreement assumes that new leaders affiliated with the church will be elected for Pittsburgh if secedes. Both are called the Diocese of Pittsburgh, though the 57-parish Diocese of Pittsburgh () isn't affiliated with the Church. It is part of the newly formed Church in North America, whose spiritual leader is , of Pittsburgh. "The Lord is blessing us. There aren't any glum faces around here," Archbishop Duncan said. </description>

He lost about 50 of his church's 630 members, who started an parish in a Baptist church a few blocks away. "There is sadness, because we love these people and have worked together with them for years," he said. He offered to let them meet at St. Thomas or to send them out as an official "plant" of the parish. But those who left wanted a clear break with the Church.

After a mission trip to New Orleans, the parish changed its pre-Ash Wednesday pancake supper to a Mardi Gras event. "We had jambalaya for 100 and ran out of food," the Rev. Murph said. </description>

            <description>At the last general convention, in 2003, the church consented to the election of an openly gay man, the , as bishop of New Hampshire. The decision deeply offended some Episcopalians in the United States and many primates abroad, who saw it as blatant disregard of Scripture. Since then, some United States congregations have left the Church, and primates overseas have threatened schism. supported 's election in 2003, and the Diocese of Nevada permits the blessing of same-sex unions. Moreover, that is a woman could further strain relations with three dioceses in the United States and many provinces that refuse to ordain women as priests and bishops, critics of the vote said Sunday. The proposed new province would unite nine groups that have left the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada over the years. This includes four Episcopal dioceses and umbrella groups for dozens of individual parishes in the United States and Canada. Jim Naughton, canon for communications and advancement in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and a liberal who frequently blogs on Anglican affairs, said he doubted that a rival Anglican province could grow much larger. “I think this organization does not have much of a future because there are already a lot of churches in the United States for people who don’t want to worship with gays and lesbians,” he said. “That’s not a market niche that is underserved.” </description>

Bishop Duncan, whose theological orientation is more evangelical, has ordained women in the diocese of Pittsburgh. Bishops of other breakaway dioceses, like Jack Iker in Fort Worth and John-David Schofield in San Joaquin, are more “Anglo-Catholic” in orientation, modeling some elements of the Roman Catholic Church, and are opposed to ordaining women as priests or bishops. </description>
