<line n="1">Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light,</line>
<line n="2">What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?</line>
<line n="3">Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,</line>
<line n="4">O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?</line>
<line n="5">And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,</line>
<line n="6">Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.</line>
<line n="7">O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave</line>
<line n="8">O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</line>
<line n="9">On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,</line>
<line n="10">Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,</line>
<line n="11">What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,</line>
<line n="12">As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?</line>
<line n="13">Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,</line>
<line n="14">In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:</line>
<line n="15">'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave</line>
<line n="16">O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</line>
<line n="17">And where is that band who so vauntingly swore</line>
<line n="18">That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion</line>
<line n="19">A home and a country should leave us no more?</line>
<line n="20">Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution.</line>
<line n="21">No refuge could save the hireling and slave</line>
<line n="22">From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:</line>
<line n="23">And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave</line>
<line n="24">O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.</line>
<line n="25">Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand</line>
<line n="26">Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!</line>
<line n="27">Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land</line>
<line n="28">Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.</line>
<line n="29">Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,</line>
<line n="30">And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."</line>
<line n="31">And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave</line>
<line n="32">O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</line>
