# 2017-09-11 ebb: There are a couple of problems here: 
# 1) What are the elements contained by head? They are <date> and <salutation> only. <person> is tucked inside <salutation> so you need to define its presence inside that rule. 
# 2) Do you want your head element to contain text floating among the elements at the same level as <date> and <salutation>? If so, you want the mixed{ } syntax, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on in the XML document from what I can see...?
# 3) Think about what your "or" pipes are indicating here: You are indicating that you want one thing only: either date or salutation or person or just text. In reality you have date *and* salutation. We see an error firing in your XML on <salutation>, but not on <date>: think about why it fired there! Your schema rule was fully satisfied by the presence of the <date> element, and could not permit anything else there. Make sense? 
date = element date {text}
salutation = element salutation {text}
# ebb: Here the element <salutation> contains more than just text, doesn't it?
person = element person {text}

body = element body {text, closing, signature, (p | person | place | subject)*}
# ebb: You appear to be getting stuck on defining **too much** inside an element--including elements that are deeper down in the hierarchy, such as person, place, and subject. Those don't belong in the schema rule for <body>, because they are not its immediate contents. There's also a problem with defining sequences and groups here. You want to review and consult these sections in the Explain Relax-NG tutorial--and I think that should help you repair this. Please come back with more questions if you're still stuck!
subject = element subject {text}
p = element p {text}
place = element place {text}
closing = element closing {text}
signature = element signature {text}
