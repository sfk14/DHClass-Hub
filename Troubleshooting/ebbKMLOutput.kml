            <description>The 2005 agreement said that property held by the central diocese -- such as endowment funds, but not necessarily parish property -- would continue to be held by the " Diocese of Pittsburgh of the  Church of the United States of America" whether or not any parishes or diocesan leaders secede. Calvary claims that the diocese has violated its end of the 2005 agreement.</description>

"St. Paul's no longer represented what we believed in. Toward the end there were people who weren't talking to me, just because my views were known to be a little more traditional," she said.</description>

St. Thomas has come through strong, and some parish events have soared in attendance. After a mission trip to New Orleans, the parish changed its pre-Ash Wednesday pancake supper to a Mardi Gras event.

"We had jambalaya for 100 and ran out of food," the Rev. Murph said.</description>

Harvest  Church in Homer City, Indiana County, moved miles away from two parishes that its 30 members left."We felt that, to have a fresh start, we should be someplace that would give us an opportunity to reach into a community that didn't already have an Anglican church," said , who leads the new congregation.

"We've all agreed that what has happened has happened," he said. "We wish the other churches well. Christianity in this country is suffering and there is plenty of room for growth for everybody."</description>

            <description>The diocese has leaders who once opposed each other, and who still disagree on matters such as gay ordination. Trust has taken time, he said.

"All of us are trying to figure out how to work together," he said. "I suspect that, to some degree, all sides are going to try to avoid divisive issues until we have a longer history of working with one another."
The Church of the Redeemer in Squirrel Hill is a gay-friendly parish that had felt marginalized in the original diocese.

"We are really happy in this new configuration," said the Rev. Cynthia Bronson Sweigert.</description>
