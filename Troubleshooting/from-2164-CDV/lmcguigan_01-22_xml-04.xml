    <body>Dear <persName ref="EdwardSackvilleWest">Eddy</persName>, 
        
        <p>
            Yes, do come to tea here on
            Thursday, <time when="5:00">5 o'clock </time>. For a novelist you show a feeble and
            perverted psychology. Any thing less like my and<persName ref="Leonard">
                Leonard's</persName> conversation I can't imagine. Did <persName ref="Leonard"
                >Leonard</persName> ever persuade me to accept an invitation? "Well, you're a damned
            fool if you do." thats his style:â€”mine is unprintable. but, in this case, flattering to
            you.
        </p>
    </body>



    <close>Your <persName ref="VirginiaWoolf">Virginia Woolf</persName></close>



    <postScriptum>It is really (now I come to think of it) extremely good and kind of you to ask
        me.</postScriptum>
